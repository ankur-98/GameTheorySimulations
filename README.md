# Game Theory Simulations
This repository is aimed at developing simulations of simple game theory concepts like the prisoner's dilemma, the stag hunt, and the ultimatum game for studying the role of agency in language use for communication. The simulations are written in an object oriented approach of creating agents which can participate in the game. Once the game is developed with simple game theory rules, language use can be added as an iterative feature for enhancing the fussiness of decision making. The simulations can be run as standalone Python scripts.

## Some games in the making
The code in the core directory of this repository follows the basic elements involved in developing any game. The following are some games in the making. 

   * **Prisoner's dilemma:** The prisoner's dilemma is a classic game in game theory where two players have to choose between cooperation and defection. 
   * **Stag hunt**: The stag hunt is a game in game theory where two players have to choose between hunting a stag or a hare.
   * **Ultimatum game**: The ultimatum game is a game in game theory where two players have to choose between accepting or rejecting a proposal.

## Demo
Currently, a basic demo of the prisoner's dilemma is available that only implements the game commonly explained as an examples in game theory books. This will soon be updated to a version using the core implementation of this repository. The demo can be run by executing the following command in the terminal:

```bash
python demo.py
```
